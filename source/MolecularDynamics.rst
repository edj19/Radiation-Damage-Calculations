Radiation Damage Simulations with Molecular Dynamics

Basic Concepts and Methods
---------------------------
Molecular dynamics simulations compute the motions of individual molecules in models of solids,liquids and gases and it is a 
technique that allows a numerical "thought experiment" to be carried out using a model that,to a limited extent,approximates a real
physical or chemical system.Such a "virtual laboratory" approach has the advantage that many such "experiments" can be easily
set up and carried out in succession by simply varying the control parameters.Morever,extreme conditions,such high temperature and obvious
downside is that the results are only as good as the numerical model.In addition,the results can be artificially biased if the 
molecular dynamics calculation is unable to sample an adequate number of microstates over the time it is allowed to run.
