Neutron Damage
===============
My another research work is the neutron radiation damage in materials and mainly focus on the displacement cross section and displacement per atom(dpa)
calculations.Quantification of displacement damage is an essential parameter to assess the strength and lifetime of
functional materials in the ITER and upcoming fusion devices such as European Demo fusion reactor.Fusion neutrons produce
different species of primary knocked on atoms(PKA) based on the different reaction channels such as (n,n'),(n,2n),(n, :math:`\alpha` ),
(n,p) and (n, :math:`\gamma` )etc.Damage cascading of PKA and other knocked on atoms produce vacancies and interstitials,both
collectively known as Frenkel pair.Displacement of atoms has adverse effects on the liftime of reactor materials and quantized
with displacement per atom(dpa).Prediction of dpa values is required to accurately predict the liftime of functional materialsto be placed in fusion reactor.
And my research route shows the following picture:

In order to calculate the dpa,you should calculate the two 
physical quantity neutron fluxes and displacement cross section where their formulas is:

.. math::
    \sigma_{dpa}(E_n)_i=\int^{T_{max}}_{E_d}(\frac{d\sigma}{dE})_i\nu (T)_idT

.. math::
    dpa/sec = \int^{E_n}_0\sigma_{dpa}(E_n)\Phi_ndE_n

where :math:`(\frac{d\sigma}{dE})_i` is the energy spectra of PKA or recoil atom from :math:`i^{th}` reaction channel,
:math:`\nu(T)_i` is the number of produced Frenkel pair from the dynamics of PKA atom of T energy, :math:`E_n` is the energy of
incident neutron, :math:`E_d` is the displacement threshold energy of target lattice, :math:`T_{max}` is the maximum energy available
for displacement damage and :math:`\Phi_n` is the neutron flux on the material.

NJOY Nuclear Data Processing
--------------------------------
The NJOY nuclear data processing system is a comprehensive computer code package for producing pointwise and multigroup nuclear
cross sections and related quantities from evaluated nuclear data in the **ENDF** format.The U.S. Evaluated Nuclear Data Files(ENDF)
have progressed through a number of versions,notably ENDF/B-III,ENDF/B-IV,ENDF/B-V,ENDF/B-VI,ENDF/B-VII.The ENDF format has also evolved
through many versions.Variations of the format called "ENDF-6" were used for ENDF/B-VI and ENDF/B-VII,and will be used in ENDF/B-VIII.The
ENDF format is also used in other nuclear data libraries such as the JEFF libraries in Europe and the JENDL libraries in Iapan,or in
specialized libraries distributed through the Nuclear Data Section of International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA0.These libraries represent
the underlying nuclear data from a physics viewpoint,but practical calculations usually require special libraries for particle transport
codes or reactor core physics codes.This is the mission of NJOY-to take the basic data from the nuclear data library and convert it into
the forms needed for applications.The NJOY code consists of a set of main modules,each performing a well-defined processing task.Each of 
these main modules is essentially a separate computer program.They are linked to one another by input and output files.And in this simple
tutorial,I will introduce some main modules which is important to radiation damage calculations.Okay,let's start our tour.

Before our learns,you should read the examples test 1 seriously and I will regard it as a main case to our learning. And what I write
here is to let you are familar with NJOY as soon as possible,in contrast to this,the theory or complete tutorials need you to read.However
I believe that what this tutorial will make you love it and do your research better.
